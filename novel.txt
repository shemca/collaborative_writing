He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
They sat at the table, brandishing knives over a bottle of cheap whiskey.
Suddenly, a portal opened up above everyone's heads, distorting time and space.
Out of the portal poured the undead, who came in search of whiskey.
It was a poor substitute for brains, but it would suffice.
The zombies gazed at the whisky drinkin' folks, a glaze over their eyes.
The room was overtaken by an awkward silence. The whisky crew and zombies, locked in a staring contest.
Finally, a gruff fellow with a big bushy beard grunted, "Hey Zombies, ye want some whisky?"
The zombies, not having the capacity to speak due to rotted vocal chords, nodded and moaned "ehhhhhhhhh"
As the first zombie took a big swig of whisky (Poured into a glass, nobody wants to drink after a zombie) a lady with black curly hair began jamming on her mandolin.
Thus marks the beginning of the first human-zombie dance off in recorded history.
